# ExtremeTimeWarping ‚è≠Ô∏é

Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a dynamic programming algorithm used determine the optimal alignment between two sequences. This paper studies the effect of time warping severity on the performance of DTW in a systematic manner and experimentally explores several ways to improve the robustness of DTW to varying levels of time warping.

## Environment setup üèóÔ∏è

Create a new enviornment from this repo's yaml file using any package manager.

```console
micromamba create -f environment.yaml # create env
micromamba activate DTW # activate env
```

## Running experiments üß™

After constructing the data by running notebook `01_prepare_data.ipynb`. Run experiments by running the following bash command. Batch options include: `train_toy`, `train_small`, `train_medium`, `train_full` and `test_full`. Experiments results will be saved in the directory specified by `output`.

The following algorithms are run via each flag:
- `dtw`: DTW1, DTW2, DTW3, DTW4, DTW5, DTW1_add3, DTW1_add4
- `down`: DTW2_downsampleQuantized, DTW2_downsampleInterpolate
- `up`: DTW2_upsampleQuantized, DTW2_upsampleInterpolate
- `adapt`: adaptiveWeight1-2
- `select`: selectiveTransitions2-5
- `hop`: DTW2_adaptiveHop, DTW2_adaptiveHopDownsample


```console
python3 02_run_experiment.py --batch train_toy \
    --output_dir experiments_toy \
    --dtw --down --up --adapt --select --hop
```

## Results üíΩ

Alignment results are saved in `results/`.

## Altering DTW implementation

To alter the original Cython implementation you will need to alter `dtw_algorithm.pyx`. To compile Cython, you will need to run the following command.

```console
python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

If there are errors with importing numpy, manually the path to the package in your environment to the `CFLAG` environment variable.

```console
export CFLAGS="-I /home/apham/ttmp/micromamba/envs/DropDTW/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/core/include $CFLAGS"
```
